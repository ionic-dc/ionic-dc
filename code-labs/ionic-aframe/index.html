                <b>Before You Get Started!</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                If you haven't already you will want to install the <em>Ionic CLI</em> and <em>Cordova</em> by running the following command.
                You may need to add <code>sudo</code> in front of this command to install on Mac:
            </p>
            <code>npm install -g ionic cordova</code>
            <p>
                If you get any warnings about <em>Node</em> or <em>NPM</em> being out of date you may need to install the latest version
                of <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">Node.js</a> and run:
            </p>
            <code>npm install -g npm</code>
        </aside>

        <h2>Generate a new Ionic Project</h2>
        <p>
            Now that you have installed the Ionic CLI you can generate your project using the blank template:
        </p>

        <code>ionic start ionic-todo blank</code>

        <p>
            It may take a minuter or two to run. You can say no to making the app <em>cordova</em> capable and you don't need to sign in to <em>Ionic Pro</em>.
            After the app is generated open that folder in your command prompt:
        </p>
        
        <code>cd ionic-todo</code>

        <p>
            Then open the <b>/ionic-todo</b> folder in your preferred code editor (<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">VSCode</a>
            or <a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank">Atom</a> work great for Ionic projects).
        </p>

        <h2>Anatomy of an Ionic Project</h2>
        <p>
            Ionic is built on the <em>Angular</em> framework for developing web applications so developing an Ionic 2+ application
            will be very similar to developing a standard Angular 2+ app.
        </p>
        <p>
            All of the <em>components</em> for our application will be in the <b>/src</b> folder
            (including the root component in the <b>/app</b> folder, and all of our page components in the <b>/pages</b> folder).
            A component will consist of a template (<b>.html</b> file defining structure and elements), class definition (<b>.ts</b> file defining actions and logic)
            and styles (<b>.scss</b> file defining layout and appearance).
        </p>
        <p>
            Along with components, you have <em>providers</em> (like the data service we will create later)
            which don’t have a html template or scss styling, but are similar in structure component's typescript class.
            These providers and will be placed in a providers folder.
        </p>



        <aside class="special">
            Replace <b>src/app/app.component.ts</b> to reflect the following:
        </aside>

<pre><code>
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

import { HomePage } from '../pages/home/home';
@Component({
  templateUrl: 'app.html'
})
export class MyApp {
  rootPage:any = HomePage;

  constructor() {
  }
}
</code></pre>

        <p>
            The <b>app.component.ts</b> file defines our <b>root component</b>. This component is special when compared to the rest of
            the components because it is the first component that will be added to the application, and from there we can
            display more components, which can then add even more components and so on. Basically, our application structure
            is like a tree with the root component at the root of that tree. So, it’s important that our root component
            knows where to find our <b>HomePage</b> as it will need to set it as the root page. Notice that we are importing the
            <b>HomePage</b> at the top of this file, and then setting it as the root page with the following code:
        </p>

<pre><code>
rootPage: any = HomePage;
</code></pre>

        <p>

            We are able to declare variables above the constructor to make them <b>member variables</b> or class members,
            meaning they will be accessible throughout the entire class by referencing <code>this.myVar</code> and it will also
            be available to your templates. In this case, we are creating a class member called <code>rootPage</code> that we will
            be able to access throughout this class, and in the template. If we take a look at the associated template
            that is in <b>src/app/app.html</b> we would see:
        </p>

<pre><code>
&lt;ion-nav [root]="rootPage"&gt;&lt;/ion-nav&gt;
</code></pre>

        <p>
            The template is accessing that class member that is stored in the <em>TypeScript</em> class file to configure the
            <code>&lt;ion-nav&gt;</code> component. Remember every component you create will consist of a <b>.html</b>
            template file and a <b>.ts</b> typescript class file.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <b>root page</b> is the first page that will be displayed in your application, and then you can navigate to other pages from there.
            To change views in an Ionic application you can either change this root page, or <b>push</b> and <b>pop</b> views on top of that page.
            Pushing a view will change to that view, and popping it will remove it and go back to the previous view.
        </p>
